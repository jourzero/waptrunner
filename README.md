# waptrunner

This tool and GIT project are under construction. The idea is to help me run through web app pen testing engagements by running through
my various tests and log issues quickly and easily. 

TODO List:
* Reporting
* Export to CSV and SSVL for Threadfix import
* Import Burp Scanner XML?
